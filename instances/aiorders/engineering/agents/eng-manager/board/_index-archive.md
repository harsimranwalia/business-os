# Engineering Board — pass log archive

Dated pass entries moved out of `_index.md` once the live board holds more than
three, newest first. The live board keeps its table plus enough recent narrative
to resume a ticket; everything older lives here.

Nothing reads this file on a pass — it is the department's history, not its
state. `lib/eng-gate-check.sh` globs `ENG-*.md` and never sees it.

This exists because every pass reads `_index.md` in full, so an append-only log
there is a tax on every future pass.
