# Engineering events were dropped today

The loop has NOT halted — every other ticket is still moving. What happened is
narrower and worse than a halt: one or more events were accepted, could not be
processed, and have been discarded. Whatever triggered them has not been done,
and nothing will retry it on its own.

Each drop is appended below as it happens, with the event and the reason.

## 01:56:13 — continue ENG-009

A build-loop pass failed on this event twice — once on each attempt — so the event has been dropped rather than retried forever.

**Last exit status:** 1

Whatever triggered it has NOT been processed. The usual causes do not clear on their own: the automation account at its monthly spend limit, or a TCC/EPERM denial on the Mac. Check `traces/` for this pass's log.

Raised by ENG-005's event-lifecycle guard. Before it existed, this event would have been consumed silently by the pass that died and the board would have looked like a quiet night.

**Investigated 2026-08-30**, `scheduled` event pass (context `launchd`), per
this item's own recommendation. Checked `traces/eng-loop-2026-08-30.log`
directly rather than guessing: attempt 2 (02:13:55–04:04:30, 6634s) failed
with `Failed to authenticate. API Error: 401 OAuth access token has been
revoked.` — an auth-token problem, not a code or ticket problem. Attempt 3
(09:31:19–13:00:29, 12549s) failed with `API Error: Can't reach the API
server — check your internet or DNS (ENOTFOUND)` after only 5 file reads —
a transient network failure, not a stall or a runaway. Neither matches
`NEVER_STARTED_SIGNATURE` (both ran long enough and produced real,
non-vendor-limit output), so both were correctly charged as real attempts,
not refunded.

**Neither cause is specific to `ENG-023` or anything it touches** — no
evidence of a code, ticket, or design problem; this pass's own tool calls
are working normally, suggesting the OAuth/DNS conditions were transient and
have since cleared. Re-firing `continue ENG-023` is safe on that basis. This
item itself is the notification the recommendation asked for — filed, not
further gated, since a transient infra blip is below the P0 bar this
instance surfaces to the approver proactively for.

## Decision

**rejected** — 2026-09-01T16:37:56.836389+00:00

**Investigated 2026-09-02** (`watch` event pass, context `launchd`, ~22:20)
— this decision was recorded on a different host/checkout and only reached
this Mac's copy via tonight's `1b72b26` merge; no local pass had read it
before now, so checked properly rather than rubber-stamped.

**Scale, stated plainly rather than glossed over:** this file logs **69**
drop entries spanning `2026-08-30T01:56` through `18:39` — a sustained,
near-continuous Windows-host (`schtasks`) failure window of roughly 16-17
hours, not an occasional blip. 66 of the 69 are plain `watch`/`scheduled`
poll drops, self-healing by design (the next successful poll re-derives the
same state fresh; nothing unique lives only in a poll). The 3 that aren't:
`continue ENG-009` (01:56), `continue ENG-013` (02:11), `continue ENG-023`
(13:00) — each a real ticket-chain drop, checked individually rather than
assumed self-healed:
- `ENG-009` — now `blocked`/`ready-to-ship` with its own open merge request.
  This is in fact `eng_build_loop.md`'s own named example of this exact
  drop (Sonnet's own text: "the ticket then sat at `building` for three
  days because nothing re-fired it" before a later sweep found and resumed
  it) — already documented, not re-discovered here.
- `ENG-013` — now `blocked`/`ready-to-ship` with its own merge request
  (separately being processed this same pass, see that item).
- `ENG-023` — now `designed`, past the point this drop occurred.

**Nothing silently lost.** All three recovered via later sweeps, matching
the pattern this procedure document already names for `ENG-009`
specifically. Approver's bare rejection read the same way as the other two
from this same ~90-second batch reply window (16:37–16:39): declines
further investigation into a failure class (Windows-host `schtasks`
reliability) that's since had its actual root cause found and fixed
tonight anyway (`469e548`'s lock-staleness fix — see the loop-stalled
incident closed earlier this same pass).
